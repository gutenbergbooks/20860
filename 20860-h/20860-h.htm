<h2>
    INTRODUCTION.
</h2>
<p>
Early in the present century John Harris&mdash;one of the successors to the
business of "Honest John Newbery," now carried on by Messrs Griffith &amp;
Farran at the old corner of St. Paul's Churchyard&mdash;began the publication
of a series of little books, which for many years were probably among
the most famous of the productions of the House. Now, however, according
to the fate which usually overtakes books for children, nearly all of
them are forgotten or unknown.
</p>
<p>
The first book in this series which was known as <i>Harris's Cabinet</i>
was "The Butterfly's Ball," and was published in January 1807. This was
followed in the same year by "The Peacock at Home" (a sequel to "The
Butterfly's Ball"), "The Elephant's Ball," and "The Lion's Masquerade;"
and then (prompted no doubt by the success of these, for we learn on the
publisher's authority that of the two first 40,000 copies were sold
within twelve months) Mr Harris brought out a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageiv" name="pageiv"></a>[iv]</span>

                                              torrent of little books
of a like kind, of which the titles were: "The Lioness's Ball," "The
Lobster's Voyage to the Brazils," "The Cat's Concert," "The Fishes'
Grand Gala," "Madame Grimalkin's Party," "The Jackdaw's Home," "The
Lion's Parliament," "The Water King's Levée;" and in 1809, by which
time, naturally enough, the idea seems to have become quite threshed out
and exhausted, the last of the Series was published; this was entitled,
"The Three Wishes, or Think before you Speak."
</p>
<p>
Of this long list of books a few of the titles are still familiar, and
one of them, "The Butterfly's Ball," may certainly claim to have become
a Nursery Classic. It is still in regular demand; the edition now in
sale being illustrated by Harrison Weir; it has been published in
various forms, and has figured in most of the collections of prose and
verse for the young that have been issued during this century. Probably
to the minds of hundreds of people past middle age few lines are more
familiar than the opening couplet&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">  "Come take up your hats, and away let us haste</p>
<p class="i3">   To the Butterfly's Ball and Grasshopper's Feast"&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-indent: 0;">
and many no doubt by a little effort of memory could repeat
the whole poem.
</p>
<p>
Hardly less famous were the three books which next

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagev" name="pagev"></a>[v]</span>

                                                   followed in order of
issue&mdash;"The Peacock at Home," "The Elephant's Ball," and "The Lion's
Masquerade." Their original size was 5 by 4 inches, and they were issued
in a simple printed paper wrapper. It is of these first four books that
the reprint is here given, and in order to present both pictures and
text with greater effect this reprint has been made upon considerably
larger paper; the text and illustrations are fac-simile reproductions
of originals from the celebrated Flaxman collection recently dispersed
at a sale by Messrs Christie, Manson, &amp; Woods, when Mr Tuer, to whom
I am indebted for their loan, became their fortunate possessor. "The
Butterfly's Ball" is not a reproduction of the first edition, which, as
will be shown later on, would be considered by those who are familiar
with the poem as incomplete. Moreover, the illustrations in the edition
here presented are obviously by the same hand as that which embellished
the other three books, and it was felt that for these reasons it would
possess a greater interest.
</p>
<p>
"The Butterfly's Ball" first appeared in the November number of the
<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, where it is said to have been written by William
Roscoe&mdash;M.P. for Liverpool, the author of "The Life of Leo X.," and well
known in the literary circles of his day&mdash;for the use of his children,
and set to music by order of their Majesties for the Princess Mary.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevi" name="pagevi"></a>[vi]</span>

 When the verses were subsequently published in book form, the text
and pictures were engraved together on copperplates. An edition, with
pictures on separate pages, appeared early in the next year, which is
the one here reproduced.
</p>
<p>
In this edition there are many variations from the previous one. The
allusions to "little Robert"&mdash;evidently William Roscoe's son&mdash;do not
occur in the former, and many slight improvements, tending to make the
verses more rhythmical and flowing, are introduced. The whole passage,
"Then close on his haunches" (p. 7) to "Chirp his own praises the rest
of the night," &amp;c. (p. 10), is an interpolation in this later edition.
It is, I believe, certain that the verses were written by Roscoe for
his children on the occasion of the birthday of his son Robert, who was
nearly the youngest of his seven sons. No doubt when they were copied
out for setting to music the allusions to his own family were omitted by
the author. A correspondent of <i>Notes and Queries</i>&mdash;who is, I believe,
a niece of the late Sir George Smart&mdash;says, in reference to the question
of the setting of the verses to music, that&mdash;
</p>
<p class="quote">
    "The MS., in Roscoe's own handwriting, as sent to Sir G. Smart
    for setting to music, is in a valuable collection of autographs
    bequeathed by the musician to his daughter. The glee was written
    for the three princesses&mdash;Elizabeth, Augusta, and Mary&mdash;daughters
    of George III, and pupils of Sir George, and was performed by them
    during one of their usual visits to Weymouth."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevii" name="pagevii"></a>[vii]</span>
</p>
<p>
"The Peacock at Home" and "The Lion's Masquerade" were, as the
title-page puts it, written "by a Lady," and we should most likely
have remained in ignorance as to who the lady was if there had not
been published in 1816 another little book of a somewhat similar
character, entitled "The Peacock and Parrot on their Tour to discover
the Author of 'The Peacock at Home,'" which, the Preface tells us, was
written immediately after the appearance of "The Peacock at Home,"
but from various circumstances was laid aside. "In the opinion of the
publishers," the Preface goes on to say, "it is so nearly allied in
point of merit to that celebrated trifle that it is introduced at this
late period."
</p>
<p>
The book relates in verse how the peacock and parrot&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">         "... far as England extends </p>
<p class="i2">   Then together did travel to visit their friends, </p>
<p class="i2">   Endeavour to find out the name of our poet, </p>
<p class="i2">   And ere we return ten to one that we know it." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
After long travelling&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   "A path strewed with flowers they gaily pursued, </p>
<p class="i3">    And in fancy their long-sought Incognita viewed. </p>
<p class="i3">    Till all their cares over in Dorset they found her, </p>
<p class="i3">    And plucking a wreath of green bay-leaves they crowned her." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
In a footnote is added, "Mrs Dorset was the authoress of 'The Peacock
at Home.'"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageviii" name="pageviii"></a>[viii]</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs Dorset, according to a note by Mr Dyce which appears on the fly-leaf
of a copy of "The Peacock at Home," in the Dyce and Forster Collection
at South Kensington, was sister to Charlotte Smith. Their maiden name
was Turner.
</p>
<p>
The British Museum Catalogue says Mrs Dorset also wrote "The Three
Wishes, or Think before you Speak," which is the last on the list of
books in <i>Harris's Cabinet</i>. (<i>See</i> p. iv.)
</p>
<p>
It seems to be clear that the same lady wrote "The Lion's Masquerade" as
"The Peacock at Home," for in "The Lioness's Ball" (a companion to "The
Lion's Masquerade") the dedication begins thus&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   "I do not, fair Dorset, I do not aspire, </p>
<p class="i5">      With notes so unhallowed as mine, </p>
<p class="i3">    To touch the sweet strings of thy beautiful lyre, </p>
<p class="i5">      Or covet the praise that is thine." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
I regret that I am unable to offer any conjecture here as to the "W. B."
who wrote "The Elephant's Ball:" the same initials appear to an appendix
to an edition of "Goody Two Shoes," published some time before 1780, but
this may be a coincidence only.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Besides the interest and merit of these little books on literary grounds,
these earlier editions are especially noteworthy

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageix" name="pageix"></a>[ix]</span>

                                                 because they were
illustrated by the painter William Mulready, and the drawings he made
for them are amongst the earliest efforts of his genius: they were
executed before he had reached man's estate. It is not a little
curious to observe in this connection how many artists who have
risen to eminence have at the outset of their career been employed
in illustrating books for children; it would indeed appear that until
comparatively recent years the veriest tiro was considered capable of
furnishing the necessary embellishments for books for the nursery&mdash;a
state of things which, we need not say, happily does not obtain in
the present day. Notwithstanding this, however, these and many other
little books of a bygone time abound in instructive indications of the
beginnings of genius which has subsequently delighted the world with
its masterpieces.
</p>
<p>
In connection with Mulready and children's books it may be interesting
to note that in 1806 a little book called "The Looking Glass" was
published, said to be written by William Godwin under the name of
"Theophilus Markliffe." This work is the history and early adventures of
a young artist, and it is known that it was compiled from a conversation
with Mulready, who was then engaged in illustrating some juvenile books
for the author, and the facts in it relate to the painter's early life.
It contains illustrations of the talent of the subject

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagex" name="pagex"></a>[x]</span>

                                                        done at three,
five, and six years old, which are presumed to be imitations of
Mulready's own drawings at the same ages.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
I cannot more fitly close these few words of Introduction than by
quoting the quaint and curious announcement with which Mr Harris was
wont to commend these little books to the public. "It is unnecessary,"
says he, "for the publisher to say anything more of these little
productions than that they have been purchased with avidity and read
with satisfaction by persons in all ranks of life." No doubt the public
of to-day will be curious to see what manner of book it was that was so
eagerly sought after by the children of the early days of the present
century, and interested in comparing it with the more finished but often
showy and sensational productions of our own time.
